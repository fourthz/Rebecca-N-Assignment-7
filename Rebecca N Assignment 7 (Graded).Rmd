This notebook is for EDRM 718 Assignment #7 linking R, GitHub, and GitKraken.
This is writing a function.

*Although you wrote a function and called it, you didn't use it in your*
*scatterplot!* (-20)

This is a function to make a linear equation 
```{r}
mod <- function(x,y,p){
  model <- lm(x~y)
  summary(model)
  attributes(model)
  Residuals <- ((resid(model)^2)^(1/2))
  Sort_Residuals <- sort(Residuals,decreasing = TRUE)
  cutoff <- Sort_Residuals[p]
  logical_residual <- (Residuals >= cutoff)
  return(logical_residual)
}
```

### Load in the data
```{r}
BBD <- read.csv("Baby Boom Data.csv")
attributes(BBD)
```

#### This is applying the function to the data set
```{r}
regression_residual <- mod(BBD$weight,BBD$minute, 10)
```

#### This is the plot for the function with the applied data
```{r}
{
  scatter <- plot(BBD$weight,BBD$minute)
  model <- lm(BBD$minute ~ BBD$weight)
  abline(model)
}
```
